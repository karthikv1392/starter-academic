abstract: Architecting IoT systems able to guarantee Quality of Service (QoS)
  levels can be a challenging task due to the inherent uncertainties (induced by
  changes in e.g., energy availability, network traffic) that they are subject
  to. Existing work has shown that machine learning (ML) techniques can be
  effectively used at run time for selecting self-adaptation patterns that can
  help maintain adequate QoS levels. However, this class of approach suffers
  from learning bias, which induces accuracy problems that might lead to
  sub-optimal (or even unfeasible) adaptations in some situations. To overcome
  this limitation, we propose an approach for proactive self-adaptation which
  combines ML and formal quantitative verification (probabilistic model
  checking). In our approach, ML is tasked with selecting the best adaptation
  pattern for a given scenario, and quantitative verification checks the
  feasibility of the adaptation decision, preventing the execution of unfeasible
  adaptations and providing feedback to the ML engine which helps to achieve
  faster convergence towards optimal decisions. The results of our evaluation
  show that our approach is able to produce better decisions than ML and
  quantitative verification used in isolation.
