abstract: Microservice-based systems have become enormously popular since
  traditional monoliths no longer meet the scalability and rapid development
  cycle of modern software systems. This is very much evident from the adoption
  of microservice architecture by large companies like Netflix, Amazon, etc.
  However, leveraging microservice poses its own challenges, and it is
  imperative that one understands clearly the fundamental concepts, advantages,
  and disadvantages of using microservices. Towards this end, the main goal of
  this short lecture series is to provide students with foundational knowledge
  on microservice architecture with a background on the history and motivation
  behind the evolution of microservices. The lecture series is divided into two
  days. The focus of the first day will be to provide details on the how, what,
  and why of microservices along with the advantages, disadvantages, design
  patterns, and common usage scenarios. The second day of the lecture will focus
  on more practical aspects with a demo explaining the technologies for
  implementing and deploying microservices as containers on the cloud and
  technologies for monitoring microservices in production.
