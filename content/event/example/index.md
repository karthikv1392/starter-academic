abstract: Microservice-based systems have become enormously popular since
  traditional monoliths no longer meet the scalability and rapid development
  cycle of modern software systems. This is very much evident from the adoption
  of microservice architecture by large companies like Netflix, Amazon, etc.
  However, leveraging microservice poses its own challenges, and it is
  imperative that one understands clearly the fundamental concepts, advantages,
  and disadvantages of using microservices. Towards this end, the main goal of
  this short lecture series is to provide students with foundational knowledge
  on microservice architecture and how they can be used for developing mobile applications, with a background on the history and motivation
  behind the evolution of microservices.
